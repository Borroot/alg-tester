# Automated testing
This is an automated testing tool to check your solution for the bin placement problem on a given sample set. Run `bin-tester -h` or `man ./bin-tester.1` for more information about your options. This tester will only work on Linux.

# Docker
This repository also includes a dockerfile from where you can run either a `Python` or `C++` (default) program. If you want `Python` just change some variables in the dockerfile. To run the dockerfile you can use `bin-tester-docker`.
